# Building A Model

## Building the Model

Typically, building a model consists of several key primary steps:
1. Develop models of all relevant single cells
1. Network structure - scale if necessary and check if a reduced order model may obscure some phenomenon
1. Connectivity (convergence/divergence) for both chemical and electrical synapses, including spatial considerations
1. Synaptic models for chemical and electrical synapses
1. Neurotransmitter effects
1. [Short-term synaptic plasticity](/compneuro/building/stsp)
1. Long-term synaptic plasticity

## Validating the model

1. Use biological data not seen by the model for validation

## Using the model for predictions

1. Work with neuroscientist to determine what predictions they suggest we try
