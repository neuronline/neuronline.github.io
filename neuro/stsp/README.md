# Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity

## General Information

Short-term synaptic plasticity (or short-term plasticity [STP]) is a phenomenon in which synaptic efficacy changes over time in response to previous presynaptic occurances. 

Two types of STP have been observed:
* **Short-Term Depression** (STD)
* **Short-Term Facilitation** (STF)

**Short-Term Depression** is caused by depletion of neurotransmitters at the axon terminal while **Short-Term Facilitation** is caused by calcium influx into the axon terminal after a spike. This increases the release probablility of neurotransmitters.

STP typically occurs on the order of hundereds to thousands of milliseconds and is temporary. Without activity the synapse will quickly return to basline levels.
